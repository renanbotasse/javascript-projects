					<h4>
						FIRST ORBITAL CLASS ROCKET CAPABLE OF REFLIGHT
					</h4>
					<p style="color:white">	
						Falcon 9 is a reusable, two-stage rocket designed and manufactured by SpaceX for the reliable and safe transport of people and payloads into Earth orbit and beyond. Falcon 9 is the worldâ€™s first orbital class reusable rocket. Reusability allows SpaceX to refly the most expensive parts of the rocket, which in turn drives down the cost of space access.
