			<h3>Hogwarts Legacy</h3>
			<p>Third time's the charm is the magic rule, so hopefully Hogwart's Legacy doesn't break it. Set in the Harry Potter universe, this RPG was first announced in 2020 with a release date set for 2021. It was then delayed to 2022. But that didn't pan out, and last year Hogwart's Legacy was delayed once more. Its latest release date is Feb. 10. Set about 100 years before The Boy Who Lived and He Who Shall Not Be Named, Hogwart's Legacy is a tantalizing concept: A big open-world game set at the most famous school of witchcraft and wizardry. 
				<br>
				<br>
				Games based on blockbuster franchises can be hit or miss. Hopefully all the delays are a sign that this promising idea has been given the love and nurturing it needs to succeed. 
				<br>		
				<br>		
				Note: The PS4 and Xbox One versions of Hogwarts Legacy will be released on April 4, with a Switch port coming on July 25.
